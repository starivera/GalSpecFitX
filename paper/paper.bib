    abstract = {Carbon spectral features are ubiquitous in the ultraviolet (UV) and far-infrared (FIR) spectra of the reionization-era galaxies. We probe the ionized carbon content of a dwarf galaxy Pox 186 using the UV, optical, mid-infrared, and FIR data taken with Hubble, Gemini, Spitzer, and Herschel, respectively. This local (z ∼ 0.0040705) galaxy is likely an analogue of reionization-era galaxies, as revealed by its extreme FIR emission line ratio, [O iii] \$88 \\,\\mu \\mathrm\{m\}\$/[C ii] \$157 \\,\\mu \\mathrm\{m\}\$ (\&gt;10). The UV spectra reveal extreme C iii] λλ1907, 1909 emission with the strongest equivalent width (EW) = 35.85 ± 0.73 Å detected so far in the local (z ∼ 0) Universe, a relatively strong C iv λλ1548, 1550 emission with EW = 7.95 ± 0.45 Å, but no He ii λ1640 detection. Several scenarios are explored to explain the high EW of carbon lines, including high effective temperature, high carbon-to-oxygen ratio, slope, and upper mass of top-heavy initial mass function, hard ionizing radiation, and in-homogeneous dust distribution. Both C iii] and C iv line profiles are broadened with respect to the O iii] λ1666 emission line. Each emission line of C iv λλ1548, 1550 shows the most distinct double-peak structure ever detected, which we model via two scenarios, firstly a double-peaked profile that might emerge from resonant scattering and secondly, a single nebular emission line along with a weaker interstellar absorption. The study demonstrates that galaxies with extreme FIR properties may also show extreme UV properties, hence paving a promising avenue of using FIR+UV in the local (via Hubble+Herschel/SOFIA) and distant (via JWST + ALMA) Universe for unveiling the mysteries of the reionization-era.},

journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
abstract = {Studying the galaxies responsible for reionization is often conducted through local reionization-era analogs; however, many of these local analogs are too massive to be representative of the low-mass star-forming galaxies that are thought to play a dominant role in reionization. The local, low-mass dwarf starburst galaxy Pox 186 is one such system with physical conditions representative of a reionization-era starburst galaxy. We present deep ultraviolet (UV) spectroscopy of Pox 186 to study its stellar population and ionization conditions and to compare these conditions to other local starburst galaxies. The new Cosmic Origins Spectrograph data are combined with archival observations to cover ∼1150–2000 Å and allow for an assessment of Pox 186's stellar population, the relative enrichment of C and O, and the escape of ionizing photons. We detect significant Lyα and low-ionization state absorption features, indicative of previously undetected neutral gas in Pox 186. The C/O relative abundance, log(C/O) = −0.62 ± 0.02, is consistent with other low-metallicity dwarf galaxies and suggests a comparable star formation history in these systems. We compare UV line ratios in Pox 186 to those of dwarf galaxies and photoionization models, and we find excellent agreement for the ratios utilizing the intense C iii], O iii], and double-peaked C iv lines. However, the UV and optical He ii emission is faint and distinguishes Pox 186 from other local starburst dwarf galaxies. We explore mechanisms that could produce faint He ii, which have implications for the low-mass reionization-era galaxies that may have similar ionization conditions.}
